# About Sei

Sei is a general purpose, open-source Layer 1 blockchain specialized for the exchange of digital assets. Leveraging a novel consensus and technical breakthroughs, Sei is the fastest blockchain in the industry. 
<ImageWithCaption img={seiLogo} alt="Sei: The fastest Layer 1 blockchain" />

We are currently working on big changes in SeiV2, where we will introduce the first paralellized EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchain. This will allow Sei to get the best of Solana and Ethereum.

Find out more on our [website](https://www.sei.io/).

If you are an EVM developer, you can find the docs for our EVM compatible public devnet [here](https://v2.docs.sei.io/).

# What problem does Sei solve?

The most successful Web3 apps are:

1) Indirect trading apps (most Metamask users ultimately use Uniswap / OpenSea) or

2) Direct trading apps, disguised as a game or NFT marketplace (like Axie or Magic Eden). 

There are major tailwinds driving the growth of on-chain trading and exchange of digital assets.
- As regulation increases on centralized exchanges, more activity flows on-chain.
- As crypto adoption increases, more assets are tokenized and the need to exchange these assets increases exponentially.

Exchanges face a major scaling problem on Layer 1s today. Exchanges face the Exchange Trilemma: between decentralization, scalability and capital efficiency, they cannot achieve all three.

# What is parallelization?

Parallelization lets you process multiple things at the same time (i.e. in parallel). This is commonly used in software engineering to take advantage of modern hardware (which has multiple cores) to process multiple workstreams at the same time.

For Sei, parallelization is used to process multiple independent transactions at the same time.

# What optimizations does Sei introduce?

Sei introduces a few major innovations:

- **Twin Turbo Consensus**: This feature allows Sei to reach the fastest time to finality of any blockchain at 400ms, unlocking web2 like experiences for applications.
- **Optimistic Parallelization**: This feature allows developers to unlock parallel processing for their applications, with no additional work.
- **Native Oracle and Matching Engine**: Infrastructure that can be easily leveraged to build exchange based applications.

Soon, Sei will also introduce an interoperable EVM. This will allow existing developers in the Ethereum ecosystem to deploy their applications, tooling and infrastructure to Sei with no changes, while benefiting from the 500x performance improvements offered by Sei.
# Sei performance metrics

With these performance optimizations, Sei is able to get

- 390 millisecond time to finality
- 5,030 transactions per second (12,500 theoretical max)

# What are the benefits of Sei?

Sei has only one value prop: exchange apps - whether itâ€™s a NFT marketplace or gaming economy- will offer the best user experience by building on Sei.
