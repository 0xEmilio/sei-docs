# Signing Transactions

## Introduction

This guide provides instructions on how to sign CosmWasm transactions on the Sei network using Compass wallet.

## Setting Up your Sei wallet
You can use Compass or Fin wallet to sign trasactions on Sei.

To set up Compass and connect to the Sei Network, refer to the instructions on the [Setting Up A Wallet](/setting-up-a-wallet) page.

## Signing Transactions

### CosmWasm Transactions

Signing CosmWasm transactions is straightforward and consistent with other Cosmos chains. When an app initiates a transaction, it will prompt you for a signature through your connected wallet, requiring your approval to proceed.
