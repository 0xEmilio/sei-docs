# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, each possessing distinct identities and attributes. Unlike fungible tokens created by the Token Factory, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

<Nfts />

This tutorial guides you through the creation and deployment of an NFT contract on Sei. By the end, you'll have deployed your own NFT contract. Select one of the tabs below to get started!

In this section, we'll be deploying a CW721 contract, a standard for NFTs in the CosmWasm ecosystem. For more about CW721, visit [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md).

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **`seid` CLI**: The Sei command-line interface tool, for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Wallet with SEI tokens on testnet**: Contains SEI tokens for transaction fees.
- **Rust Programming Environment**: Install Rust for CosmWasm contract development. Installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Understanding of CosmWasm**: Familiarize yourself with CosmWasm smart contracts. Start with the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).
- **Docker**: Required for using the CosmWasm Rust Optimizer tool. Install from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

  You can obtain testnet tokens from one of the faucets listed
  [here](/getting-tokens/faucets).

## Setting Up Your Environment

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the Wasm rust compiler installed to build Wasm binaries. To install it, run:

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, clone the `CW721-base` contract from the [cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) repository:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts.git
cd cw-nfts/contracts/cw721-base
```

To test your setup, run:

```bash copy
cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests pass.

## Customizing the Contract

Review and modify the `cw721-base` contract to meet your requirements. This might include updating metadata structures or changing the minting process.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, run:

```bash copy
cargo wasm
```

This compiles a Wasm binary for uploading to Sei.

<Callout type="info">
  Note: The generated Wasm file will be located in the root directory of the
  `cw-nfts` repository, not in the `cw721-base` subdirectory. Make sure to
  navigate to the root directory to see your compiled `.wasm` file in
  `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/`.
</Callout>

Before we can upload the contract to the chain, we have to use the [CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) to reduce the contract size. While not required, this is highly recommended for live contracts.

```bash copy
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0 ./contracts/cw721-base/
```

This will generate an optimized Wasm contract in `/artifacts`.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you're using a Mac M1 machine, you might need to use the Arm 64-bit
  optimizer. However, it's important to note that the native Arm version
  generates wasm artifacts that differ from those produced by the Intel version.
  For production environments, we strongly recommend building contracts with the
  Intel optimizers to ensure reliability. Learn more
  [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer).
</Callout>

## Deploy the Contract

Upload your contract:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm store artifacts/cw721_base.wasm --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=5000000 --fees=500000usei
```

Replace `$ACCOUNT` with your account name or address. This command stores the contract on the chain and outputs a code ID.

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed descriptions of these arguments, use `seid help` in the CLI.
</Callout>

Instantiate your contract using the code ID:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm instantiate $CONTRACT_CODE_ID '{"name":"$COLLECTION_NAME", "symbol":"$SYMBOL"}' --from=$ACCOUNT --admin=$ADMIN_ADDRESS --label=$LABEL --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=250000 --fees=25000usei
```

Replace `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`, `$ACCOUNT`, `$LABEL`, and `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` appropriately. Successful instantiation will provide the NFT contract address.

- `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`: Code ID of the uploaded contract (can be found in the output of the previous `store` command)
- `$COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the collection
- `$SYMBOL`: Symbol of the collection
- `$ACCOUNT`: Your account name or address
- `$LABEL`: Any label for easy identification, can be used to look up the contract in future
- `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` (Optional): Address that will have administrative privileges over the contract, such as the ability to upgrade it

## Conclusion

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've successfully created and deployed an NFT contract on Sei.
